Visitation Log App

A simple, secure, and user-friendly web application designed for parents navigating child visitation rights. The app allows users to:

Log Events: Record attempts to organize visits, responses (or lack of response) from the other party, and any major events that should be documented.

User Accounts: Each parent can log in with their own account so entries are stored privately and securely.

Clean Interface: Built with a modern, accessible, and stylish design so people of all ages can use it with ease.

Data Storage: Entries are stored safely, ensuring a complete history of visitation interactions.

PDF Reports: Generate professional PDF summaries of all entries to share with legal representatives or court officials.

Deploy Anywhere: Easily hosted on GitHub Pages, with the option to migrate to a custom domain later.

The goal is to empower parents in custody and visitation battles with a reliable tool for accurate record-keeping, presented in a way that is professional, simple, and court-ready.
